TrailDB Haskell bindings
========================

![TrailDB logo](traildb_logo_512.png?raw=true)

These are the official Haskell bindings to [TrailDB](http://traildb.io/). Most
of the API is covered. Check out System.TrailDB module for some examples and
documentation.

You need `traildb`, `Judy` and `cmph` libraries installed to compile and use
these bindings. The latter two are dependencies of TrailDB itself so if you
have the C library TrailDB, you have what you need.
